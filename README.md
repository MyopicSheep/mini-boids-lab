# Mini Boids Lab
This lab is made up of 3 scripts that are inspired by [Craig Reynold's Boids model](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/) for computerized animation. Each script uses the theory behind the Boids model to assign a flexible range of movement to each shape based on their position relative to one another. The end result is movement with an element of unpredictability.
